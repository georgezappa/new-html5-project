# Responsive HTML, CSS and SCSS starter templates

/*=======================*/

## What is this?

This includes basic HTML, CSS and corresponding SCSS.

This is designed to provide a light footprint, and excludes unnecessary components.

In some cases, the class names are designed to be similar or the same as other larger frameworks so that moving between frameworks is less of a hassle. The SCSS source is provided, as well as plain CSS and a compressed version of the CSS.

Included is the [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) library, basic typography and styles, and a responsive grid. Column
classes accommodate different coding styles. For example, a seven column span could be defined with the class ".seven" (similar to Foundation 3
naming conventions), or ".col-7" (similar to Bootstrap 3 naming conventions). Additional classes are available for ".half," ".one-quarter,"
".two-thirds," etc.
